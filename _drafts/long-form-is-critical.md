**Am I thinking critically about the topic at hand or am I reacting to provacative communication?**

2020 seems to be the year of large disruptive events complete with a huge bombardment of information.  SARS-ncov-2.  COVID-19.  Lockdowns.  Economic Impact.  George Floyd killing.  Protestors.  Riots.  Antifa.  BLM.  CHAZ.

In addition to all of that, many of us are trying to parent, work-from-home, find a job, deal with family or health issues.  Our time is finite and precious.  **How can we process all of this?  How can we evaluate all the messages coming our way in a productive manner?**  

**Seeking out and digesting long-form, primary sources where possible is the key.**

## The need for critical thinking and real face-to-face discussion

2020 has been (and will continue to be) a year where we are bombarded with messages about very important topics.  A pandemic. Lockdowns. Jobs and the economy.  The killing of George Floyd.  Protests. Riots. Antifa. BLM. CHAZ.

Do you feel like a boxer who's taken a couple too many punches?  Are you disoriented?  Will another punch land?

A lot is happening in our world.  Problems and crises arise.  Politicians and protestors and provactuers take action.  We bear the consequences.

Do you feel the pressure pushing you to align with a certain viewpoint on these topics?  Do you feel the desire to talk about these challenging issues, but you fear being judged because you may question the narative (or even pose the wrong question)?

This is an election year and it certainly seems that with each of these major crises, we are pushed into oposing camps. 

What is at risk?  Critical thinking and reasoned discussion are at risk.  Why?

## Polictians, Political Parties, and Movements all benefit when we set aside critical thinking

Both sides of the political divide want you to be upset and to be voting.  If we kick this guy out, our guy will come in and set things straight!  If we don't support our guy, the crazies will take over and the world will come to an end!  Vote! Vote! Vote!

Voting may or may not be the best course of action.  Certainly reasoned thought, critical thinking, seeking to understand the real issue at hand, discussing various viewpoints--these things should proceed any action if we want that action to be just and productive.

## The long-form

An answer to this is to seek the long-form.  Twitter and Facebook and other social media are geared toward quickly sharing short pieces of information.  TV news is time constrained.  Political ads are clipped and supershort.  Quotes and photos are taken out of context are presented to promote a conclusion.

The long-form is either an interview where a genuine discussion occurs or a longer written artical where the author is able to fully make their point and support it with references.  Ideally the long-form includes primary sources, eye-witnesses or experts in the field who are actually in the field.

I'll link to some example below.

## Processing this information

How we approach information is very important.  Here is a video describing two ways of thinking.  The context is related to a popular video on racism.  The vlogger is highlighting the ways of thinking that are available to us and he's recommending highly that we take that into account.

1.  Collect data
2.  Analyze data
3.  Form conclusions supported by data

Versus

1.  Form conclusion
2.  Find sources of data that support conclusion
3.  Reject sources of data that do not support conclusion

## my take away

To come together to overcome these crises, we must become better at using critical thinking and entering into real discussion with one another.
