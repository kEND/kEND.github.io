## Reasonable Questions

> Psalm 4:7 Wisdom is supreme—so acquire wisdom, and whatever you acquire, acquire understanding! (NET)

Below, I'm going to ask some **reasonable questions** about what's going on in our world today (April 2020).  

If you're concerned about me and my mindset during this time, I've included a list of things that I remember as I've been asking myself these questions.  You have your own worldview and it may not be mine.  

Please read the questions and consider or find some answers.  If you're game, tell me your thoughts in an email: my.name@gmail.com.  I've found some answers, let me know if you want to know what I've found.

### Remember...

If you are a follower of Jesus and you believe in his death and resurrection, and you consider the bible to be the word of God and you believe that God, by his character, cannot lie, then…

- the world, and all who are in it, are in a fallen corrupt state due to rebellion against God, and
- the world system is empowered by and led by God’s enemy--a powerful, personal spiritual being--Satan; and
- the whole world will cry out for one ruler to bring peace and that ruler will be the anti-Christ; and
- in this context, when we are about to erupt into a world devastating war, Jesus will return and he will be victorious, setting up a new earthly kingdom where peace and justice exist for all; and
- We don’t know the timing of these events and we are secure in our relationship with God.  He has adopted us as his children, indwelling us with his Spirit as a downpayment on our eternal life with him; therefore
- We can and should trust him; and
- We should prayerfully consider acting on the information below.  The status quo is gone.

If you are not a follower of Jesus, seek him out.  He wants to fill your life with purpose and a hope that surpases all you are facing and will face!

### Reasonable questions to ask about…

#### ...COVID-19

- What is it?
- What is the infection rate?
- What is the mortality rate?
- What segments of population are most affected?
- How effective are the tests?
- How are deaths considered COVID-19 deaths?
- If these two numbers (deaths and infections) are off, how dramatically does that affect the rates?
- On what models were the earliest decisions made?
- How have these models changed?
- Why does all of this matter?

#### ...the response

- What was the response to COVID-19?
- Given the answers above, how was this response warranted?  How was it unwarranted?
- How would you determine the legality of the response?

#### ...the economy

- What are some of the current economic impacts of the lockdowns?
- Where would you find data on new claims for unemployment insurance?
- How do these numbers compare to the most recent financial downturn (financial crisis of ‘08-’09)?
- What is your economic outlook for the remainder of the year?  Will you change your purchasing behavior from what it was in February?
- How interconnected are businesses in our modern economy?  How is their purchasing behavior changing? their hiring behavior?
- If a business is rethinking their entire business from the ground up based on new revenue models (lower than before the lockdowns), how long do you think it will take for them to plan a new strategy and implement it?  Will they be hiring and starting new projects in the meantime?

### Conclusion

- There are questions worth asking.  These are not all of the questions.
- Dig for the truth.  Share what you find.
- The world is always changing.  Each of us is changing.  Perhaps this latest set of changes is going to bigger than we would have guessed.
- It's okay to prepare.  It's okay to act.  You are a free-choosing being, of the greatest value, an image bearer of the Creator himself!
