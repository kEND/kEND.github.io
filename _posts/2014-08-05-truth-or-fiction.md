# Truth or fiction

> Marcus Aurelius: Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter, and I am a good father.

> Lucilla: This is a pleasant fiction, is it not? [1]

We want the truth (and we want our fiction).  We want security and significance.  Change seems to be the
direct enemy of security and significance.  We live in an uncertain world, always changing.  In the west,
marketing is a science and we are bombarded by all sorts of messages that promise and don't fulfill.  

Is despair the answer?  It all depends on where you place your hope.  In what are you trusting?

You can choose to trust in no one and nothing.  Or you can choose to believe in someone or something?
