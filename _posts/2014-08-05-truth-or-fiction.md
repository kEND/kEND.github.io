## Truth or fiction

> Marcus Aurelius: Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter, and I am a good father.

> Lucilla: This is a pleasant fiction, is it not? [[imdb]]

We want the truth (and we want our fiction).  We want security and significance.  Change seems to be the
direct enemy of security and significance.  We live in an uncertain world, always changing.  In the west,
marketing is a science and we are bombarded by all sorts of messages that promise and don't fulfill.  

Is despair the answer?  It all depends on where you place your hope.  In what are you trusting?

You can choose to trust in no one and nothing.  Or you can choose to believe in someone or something?

I've placed my trust in something I cannot prove to be true.  There is a lot of compelling evidence though.  By trusting Him, I can turn around and trust others.  I can trust my wife to love, but not without failing.  I can trust my employer to provide work for me to do, but not without failing.  Clients can trust us to deliver well on their projects, but not without our failing to do so.

Trust isn't a binary decision.  It's a slider.
